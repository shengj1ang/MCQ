The Case Study!

 

Granby limited is a company that manufactures various types of fasteners at two major manufacturing sites in the North West of England. The company has 5 major departments - Human Resources, Finance, Operations, Sales and Information Technology. Granby limited employs 178 people and has recorded an annual turnover of approximately £37m over the last 5 financial years.

These fasteners are made from stainless steel, titanium alloy and glass fibre reinforced polymer. Fasteners are either threaded bolts or threaded nuts. The following sizes are manufactured M6 M8 M10 M12 M14 M16 M18 M20 and M25. Their manufacturing process mainly involves turning fasteners using a lathe from 3m bar stock down to the required size. Granby Limited is considered top of their class due to their Just-in-Time raw materials policy, 5-year 4 star rating in customer satisfaction, 24-hour response time to customer queries and a throughput rate of 1 tonne of fasteners per week. Under ideal conditions, Granby Limited typically runs a 3-shift (8 hours per shift) continuous operations pattern. The industrial plant is expected to run throughout the year except on bank holidays and during annual maintenance shutdowns. Each shift comprises of 3 multi-skilled machinists and a supervisor.

 

Considering that the fasteners produced by Granby limited are used for a variety of complex engineering functions, especially in the hydraulic systems of mobile cranes, rolling stock fixations, process control compressors and aircraft turbo-chargers, it is very important that the design specifications match the finished products. This high accuracy target is achieved through the following practices:

* Engaging the services of only City & Guilds certified machinists. 
* Selection of stainless steel bar stock with at least 92.4% purity levels
* Consistent lathe spindle speeds based on 5-year standard operating procedures
* Routine use of thread gauge to confirm bolts and nuts thread depth

Under normal scenarios, the main raw materials required for Granby’s operations are delivered from across the world by 3 main suppliers:

* Norust Limited is based in Lebanon and supplies stainless steel, with an average of 17 weeks delivery lead time from order request to reception of stock at the warehouse of Granby Limited. Stainless steel typically has a 12 months turnover but new orders are initiated after the 10th month.
* Aerometals Limited is based in Disley (Stockport) and supplies titanium alloys, with an average of 3 days delivery lead time from order request to reception of stock at the warehouse of Granby Limited supply titanium alloy. Titanium alloys typically have a 12 days turnover but new orders are initiated after the 10th day.
* Toughplast Limited is based in Camelot and supplies polymers, with an average of 7 days delivery lead time from order request to reception of stock at the warehouse of Granby Limited supply polymers. Polymers typically have a 6-9 weeks turnover but new orders are initiated after the 8th week.
 

In recent times, combinations of several occurrences have significantly impacted the ability of Granby Limited to accurately predict product delivery times to its major customers (AYK Turbo-chargers, MoBad cranes and TiJo twin-lobe compressors). The most significant of such occurrences are:

* Delays in shipment from Disley (Stockport) due to reductions in factories productivity as a result of rising Covid-19 infection rates
* Cancellation of shipments from Lebanon due to recent explosions at the main port
* Delays at Camelot-England border due to increased goods clearance checks as a result of Brexit.
* Incessant cyber-attacks on the main enterprise resource planning system
* Legal disputes with major shareholders on reducing value of dividends over the last 3 years despite approximately 3-5% annual rise in return on investment (ROI)
* Reduced throughputs due to poor lathe availability (uptime of 17 hours and downtime of 7 hours)
* 9% rise in rework rates due to high amounts of faulty bolts. A combination of failure modes and effects analysis with reliability centred maintenance initiatives are due to high staff turnovers and frequent loss of calibration of lathe. The lathe issues were rectified by changing the minimum lathe speed to 350 rpm while the staff issue was rectified by changing the company that supplies machinists.
 

As a result of the aforementioned disruptions, Granby Limited has been mandated to change its operations process from a fully continuous process to a hybrid (i.e. batch and continuous) so as to reduce the impacts of irregular supply of key raw materials on energy consumption, based on real-time market intelligence provided by MACE Analytics. Additionally, Granby Limited also had to deviate from their well-established Just-in-Time policy for key raw materials to keeping large inventory of buffer stock. Besides helping Granby Limited anticipate imminent dangers within their sector, recommendations from MACE Analytics led to research and development activities in the areas of incorporating alternative raw materials that can be developed within close proximity of Granby Limited’s main manufacturing site. One of such raw materials is Graphene, which is now available at renowned higher educational institutions such as UoM. If discovered to possess the required strength, the incorporation of Graphene could potentially reduce energy costs and raw materials delivery lead times by as much as 37%.
