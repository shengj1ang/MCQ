Test6
Which of these is a reason for continuous improvement in operations
A.	High lost time injuries frequency rate (LTIFR)
B.	Growing/shrinking markets
C.	All of the above✅
D.	Low plant reliability

Which of these is NOT considered one of the 3 KEY features of a typical process?
A.	Variability
B.	Interface
C.	Dependency
D.	Cost-effectiveness✅
Response Feedback:	All options except cost-effectiveness are inherent characteristics of any operations process, irrespective of its size, sector or experience. This is because every operation has elements of variability because market demands are not fixed, which will also cause variability in the amount of raw materials that you procure. With regards to dependency, different process stages also depend on each other, since the outputs from one stage serves as the inputs to another stage. Similarly, there are several interface points, since there are instances whereby two or more activities occur simultaneously at the same point. However, cost-effectiveness is NOT a characteristic of ALL operations, else there won't be bankruptcy in organisations. Cost-effectiveness is what all organisations hope to achieve, but not all have it.
